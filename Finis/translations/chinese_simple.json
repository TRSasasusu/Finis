    "CUMIN: We collided twice! It tipped at the beginning and fell straight down!": "库敏：我们撞了两次！它一开始就倾斜了，然后径直掉了下来！",
    "MENTH: There might be a connection between the pod's warp failure and our Vessel coming here. In any case, we have no choice but to go outside first.": "门斯：逃生舱的跃迁失败和我们的飞船来到这里可能有关联。不管怎样，我们别无选择，只能先出去看看。",

    "MENTH: I'm not sure you can read the Nomai language, but I'd like to note this anyway: You probably shouldn't end up in the abyss.": "门斯：我不知道你是否能读懂挪麦语，但无论如何我想说明一点：你或许不该最终坠入深渊。",
    "MENTH: (Don't you think it's a bit of a joke to put two abyss together?)": "门斯：（把两个“深渊”双关并用，你不觉得有点巧妙吗？）",
    "MENTH: Still, it's probably your destiny to reach it in the end. That's why we put everything we found back in its original place to avoid making things easier due to our presence. I hope that you will take some time to think about its meaning.": "门斯：尽管如此，最终抵达那里或许是你的命运。这就是为什么我们把找到的所有东西都放回原处——不想因为我们的存在让事情变得过于简单。希望你能花些时间思考其中的意义。",
    "MENTH: Well, the ones that are too heavy will remain the same! Okay, now that the Vessel is ready, it's time to say goodbye. (...Ah, I left all the notes as they were... deleting them goes against the beliefs of the species!)": "门斯：好吧，那些太重的东西就保持原样吧！好了，飞船已经准备好了，是时候说再见了。（……啊，我把所有笔记都留着了……删除它们违背我们种族的信仰！）",

    "MENTH: Oh, Escall, where have you gone? Since it's about you, I'm sure you've found something outrageous. If I find you, I'd like to hear your story.": "门斯：哦，艾斯科尔，你去哪儿了？以你的性格，肯定发现了什么惊人的东西。如果我找到你，一定要听听你的经历。",

    "SACCO: It's probably because you two keep pushing forward without worrying.": "萨科：还不是因为你们俩总是毫无顾虑地往前冲。",

    "SACCO: This is where the first collision occurred. Then I guess we bumped into this beautiful board. It must be quite sturdy as it doesn't have any scratches.": "萨科：这里就是第一次碰撞发生的地方。那我猜我们当时是撞到了这块漂亮的石板。它一点划痕都没有，肯定特别坚固。",
    "SACCO: But it's strange. Does that mean there was only one board like this standing upright on the hill?": "萨科：但这也太奇怪了。难道说山上原本就只竖着这么一块石板？",
    "MENTH: This one is definitely beautiful. I want to take it home, ... but it's a bit too heavy.": "门斯：这块石板确实很漂亮。我真想把它带回家，……可惜太重了。",

    "SACCO: So on this planet, they were using the corpses as an energy source to build cannons and steal things from other planets?": "萨科：这么说，这颗行星上的人竟然用尸体当能源，用来制造大炮，还从其他行星偷东西？",
    "MENTH: I see. Perhaps, hypothesis: they salvaged the warp technology from our Vessel and the escape pod, which is why we're stuck in this system.": "门斯：我明白了。或许可以这样推测：他们从我们的飞船和逃生舱里回收了跃迁技术，这就是我们被困在这个星系的原因。",
    "CUMIN: What the heck! Then we'll never be able to get out of here!": "库敏：什么嘛！那我们岂不是永远都出不去了！",
    "MENTH: Don't worry! Our Vessel has a spare warp core. And I just heard from our supervisor that it's working fine. So we'll leave the system as soon as we finish investigating this planet.": "门斯：别担心！我们的飞船有备用跃迁核心。而且我刚跟飞船监管确认过，它运行得很好。所以我们一完成这颗行星的调查就离开这个星系。",
    "MENTH: Well, it was only after your Vessel was gone that a spare warp core became recommended, Escall.": "门斯：说起来，艾斯科尔，就是因为你的飞船出事了，备用跃迁核心才成为强制配置的呢。",

    "MENTH: The <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>community<![CDATA[</Color>]]> is said to have collapsed due to the conflict. There are other planets in this star system besides this one, so there may be a conflict with them.": "门斯：据说<![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>这个社群<![CDATA[</Color>]]>已经因为冲突瓦解了。这个恒星系统里除了这颗行星还有其他星球，所以他们可能和那些星球也发生过冲突。",
    "MENTH: But what did the king, who remained alone, do? They didn't take revenge, what was they thinking?": "门斯：但那个独自存活下来的国王后来做了什么？他们没有选择复仇，到底在想些什么？",
    "CUMIN: Even if the battle is over, it's going to happen again because of this guy spinning around at the top?": "库敏：难道说就算战斗结束了，就因为这个在顶部旋转的东西，一切还会重演吗？",
    "SACCO: It's like there's something that causes endless death and rebirth. I wonder if such a thing really exists.": "萨科：就好像有某种东西在引发无尽的死亡与重生。真不知道这样的东西是否真的存在。",
    "CUMIN: Is it somewhere in the universe? How did it come about? Is this a machine made by someone?": "库敏：它在宇宙的某个角落吗？它是怎么出现的？是别人制造的机器吗？",
    "MENTH: And what worries me is... something as if there is a way to step out of that cycle and become nothing. Did this king have any means?": "门斯：而我担心的是……似乎存在一种能跳出这个循环、归于虚无的方法。这位国王是否掌握了这种方法？",

    // finis_battlefield.xml
    "SACCO: This is a terrible sight... If the picture is correct, the only one who survived was the king. They couldn't win even with this cannon. It's a sight I don't really want Cumin to see...I wonder if she's okay.": "萨科：这景象太惨烈了……如果这幅画是真实的，那唯一活下来的就只有国王了。就算有这门大炮，他们还是没能赢。这种景象我真不想让库敏看到……不知道她还好吗。",
    "CUMIN: After the light from this rod finishes spreading, the way you see things changes! There's a delay of about one second... I think?": "库敏：这根权杖的光完全散开后，看东西的方式就变了！大概有一秒钟的延迟……我觉得是这样！",
    "SACCO: She seems okay...maybe.": "萨科：她看起来好像没事……也许吧。",
    "CUMIN: ...Wait, up! Look at the sky!": "库敏：……等等，抬头！快看天空！",

    "MENTH: I've never seen anything like this. …Wait, isn't that Escall's Vessel?! Why, why! …No, calm down, analyze calmly... The angle of this line probably represents the proximity... the dot product, and then that symbol...": "门斯：我从没见过这种东西。……等等，那不是艾斯科尔的飞船吗？！怎么会在这里！……不，冷静点，冷静分析……这条线的角度可能代表距离……是点积运算，然后那个符号……",
    "CUMIN: The <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Eye<![CDATA[</Color>]]>! ... Don't they look like that?": "库敏：是<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>宇宙之眼<![CDATA[</Color>]]>！……它们看起来不像吗？",
    "MENTH: Ah, that's good. Yes, it shows how close we are to the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Eye<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, doesn't it? So, Escall, you're in the middle of this whole thing with the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Eye<![CDATA[</Color>]]>... Ok, let's get out of here and go find the thorn planets across the Universe!": "门斯：啊，说得对。没错，这应该是在显示我们离<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>宇宙之眼<![CDATA[</Color>]]>有多近，对吧？所以，艾斯科尔，你也卷入了和<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>宇宙之眼<![CDATA[</Color>]]>相关的这整件事里……好吧，我们先离开这里，去寻找宇宙中那些荆棘行星！",
　　"CUMIN: Let's go!": "库敏：出发！",

    "CUMIN: There have been lines stuck in your body for a while now, mentor. Are you okay?": "库敏：导师，有线条卡在你身上好一会儿了。你没事吧？",
    "MENTH: Oh, I don't feel anything in particular. It's a strange thing in terms of the closeness, but it just means... I guess I have infinite possibilities!": "门斯：哦，我没什么特别的感觉。就距离而言确实挺奇怪的，但这只能说明……我想我拥有无限的可能性！",
    "SACCO: I hope so.": "萨科：希望如此吧。",

    // finis_moon_collector.xml
    "MENTH: I know this one! <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>The Collector<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, right? They once released a deadly gas that could have wiped out life in an entire galaxy, but were contained by a tribe of Nomai and other species. Yes, it was a tribe led by a Nomai called Nerine.": "门斯：我认识这个！<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>收集者<![CDATA[</Color>]]>，对不对？他们曾经释放过一种能摧毁整个星系生命的致命气体，但被挪麦人的一个家族和其他物种联手封印了。没错，那个家族的首领是个名叫内琳的挪麦人。",
    "CUMIN: Mentor, you know a lot! The Nomai called Nerine is also amazing!": "库敏：导师你懂得真多！那个叫内琳的挪麦人也太厉害了吧！",
    "MENTH: That's right... Actually, there was a kid on the Escall's Vessel who knew a lot about this, and he gave me a passionate speech about it. I hope they're safe too.": "门斯：是啊……其实，艾斯科尔的飞船上有个孩子对这件事特别了解，还跟我热情地讲解过。……希望他们也都平安无事。",

    // finis_moon_chime.xml
    "SACCO: If your hypothesis is correct, then there is something closer to <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>the Collector<![CDATA[</Color>]]> than the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Eye<![CDATA[</Color>]]>. But what is that structure? It almost looks like it came out of the Eye. …By the way, what are you investigating?": "萨科：如果你之前的推测是对的，那有个东西比<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>宇宙之眼<![CDATA[</Color>]]>更接近<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>收集者<![CDATA[</Color>]]>。但那个结构到底是什么？看起来简直就像是从宇宙之眼里出来的。……对了，你在调查什么？",
    "MENTH: Hmm... I thought these broken crystals looked similar to the crystals from <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>the Collector<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, but upon closer inspection, they were subtly different. Rather, the material that makes up this planet is closer to <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>the Collector<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, or you could even say it's the same. In other words (although there are many speculations), is this planet we're on now <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>the Collector<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, and these broken crystals were...retrieved from that structure?": "门斯：嗯……我原以为这些破碎的水晶和<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>收集者<![CDATA[</Color>]]>的水晶很像，但仔细检查后发现有细微差别。相反，构成这颗行星的物质更接近<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>收集者<![CDATA[</Color>]]>，甚至可以说完全相同。也就是说（虽然只是推测），我们现在所在的这颗行星就是<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>收集者<![CDATA[</Color>]]>，而这些破碎的水晶是……从那个结构中回收的？",
    "SACCO: Too much speculation. But if that's the case, what does it mean that this planet and that structure are similar? For the inhabitants of this planet to see that their planet is similar to the one that came out of the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Eye<![CDATA[</Color>]]>?": "萨科：推测也太多了吧。……不过，要是真的是这样，这颗行星和那个结构相似又有什么意义呢？对这颗行星的居民来说，发现自己居住的星球和从<![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>宇宙之眼<![CDATA[</Color>]]>里出来的东西相似，又能说明什么？",
